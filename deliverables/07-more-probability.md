More probability
========

Please read sections 5.6 through 5.13 of Understanding Probability.

1. Consider the following information about the 2022 US population from the Census Bureau 

| Region | Proportion |
|--------|------------|
| Northeast | .17 |
| Midwest   | .21 |
| West      | .24 |
| South     | .38 |

Also suppose that the following table describes the probability that an individual will call a carbonated, sugary beverage *soda*.

| Region | Probability |
|--------|-------------|
| Northeast | .87 |
| Midwest   | .71 |
| West      | .54 |
| South     | .68 |

What is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the 2022 US population will will call a carbonated, sugary beverage *soda*?

2. Which rule of probability did you use to calculate the solution to question 1?

3. Using the tables from question 1, calculate the probability that an individual is from the West given that they used the word *soda* to order a beverage at lunch?  (Hint: A contingency table may help.)

4. What is a Dutch Book?

5. What is a scoring rule?

6. Which scoring rule results in the same basic rules of probability?

7. Why does the author describe so many different methods for establishing the rules of probability?

8. The author describes the *prisoners' dilemma* as a *word of caution*.  What issue or challenge is the author demonstrating with the example of the *prisoners' dilemma*?

9. What are the issues raised by the author in section 5.12 for expressions like $P(\text{rain tomorrow})$?
