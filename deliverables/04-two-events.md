Here is the data from the in-class survey about soft drinks which you will use in the following problems.

| Drink preference | Sugar preference |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Something else | Regular |
| Something else | Regular |
| Cola (Coke, Pepsi, etc) | Zero sugar or Diet |
| Something else | Regular |
| Something else | Regular |
| Cola (Coke, Pepsi, etc) | Zero sugar or Diet |
| Something else | Regular |
| Something else | Zero sugar or Diet |
| Cola (Coke, Pepsi, etc) | Regular |
| Cola (Coke, Pepsi, etc) | Zero sugar or Diet |

1. Use the data to generate a contingency table of counts and proportions. Report counts with proportions in parentheses, for example `23 (0.39)`.  (This is what is meant by  `N (p)`.)

|             | Colas       |   Not Colas |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Regular**     |  N (p)    |    N (p)     |
| **No sugar/Diet** | N (p)    |    N (p)      |

2. Add to the table conditional column and row proportions and counts. With sugar preferences on the rows, the conditional row proportions are $P(\text{Drink}|\text{Sugar})$.  Likewise, with drink preferences on the columns, conditional column proportions are $P(\text{Sugar}|\text{Drink})$.
3. Add marginal proportions and counts.  The final table will look something like this:

|             | Colas       |   Not Colas | Total  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Regular**     |  N (p)    |    N (p)     | N (p) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Row     |  N (p)    |    N (p)     | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col     |  N (p)    |    N (p)     | |
| **No sugar/Diet** | N (p)    |    N (p)      | N (p) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Row     |  N (p)    |    N (p)     | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Col     |  N (p)    |    N (p)     | |
| Total | N (p)    |    N (p)     | N (p) |
