Randomization
========

Please read sections 8.4 to 8.9 of Understanding Uncertainty.

1. In section 8.6, the author compares a medical trial to an agricultural trial.  Summarize why the conclusions of the trials were different, even though the data were exactly the same.

2. Consider the figure below, which describes the medical trial.  Create a figure that represents the agricultural trial, using the terms variety, yield, and height.

3. Suppose that you were tasked with creating a randomization table for a trial.  The investigators are concerned that outcomes differ by diabetes status.  Create randomization tables using R which accounts for diabetes status.  Suppose the total number of trial participants is 100, of which 25 will have diabetes.
