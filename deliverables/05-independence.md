Here is the data from the in-class survey about soft drinks which you will use in the following problems.

| Something else | Regular |
| Something else | Zero sugar or Diet |
| Cola (Coke, Pepsi, etc) | Regular |
| Cola (Coke, Pepsi, etc) | Zero sugar or Diet |

1. If the proportions in the contingency table represented probabilities, would drink preference and sugar preference be independent?

2. Is a preference for Cola positively or negatively or not associated with a preference for regular sugar?

3. Consider the population of individuals who suffer from migraine headaches.

|  | Fewer than 3 migraines per month | 3 or more migraines per month |

What can you conclude from this data about the effectiveness of the more toxic treatment? (Hint: Section 4.7)
