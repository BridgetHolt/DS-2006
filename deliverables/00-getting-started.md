Getting started
========

In this assignment, you will create a GitHub repository for the course.

1. On your Github homepage, click the "+" in the upper right hand corner.  Then click "New repository".
1. Name your repository ds2006-lastname-firstname.  For example, mine would be called ds2006-stewart-thomas.
1. Make the repository private by clicking the toggle next to the lock icon labeled "Private".
1. Navigate to Settings then Collaborators.  (You may have to re-enter your password.)
1. Click "Add people" and add thomasgstewart and eanelson01

Once your repository is created, you will submit a practice deliverable via GitHub.  Like all the deliverables, this one will be a blog post. 

-   The audience of your blog post is the University of Virginia Data Science community.

-   Your post will be a brief profile about a fellow student (assigned randomly to you in class).

-   The profile can include professional details (What was their journey to data science?), and it can also include informal details such as hobbies, hometown, favorite books/movies/artists, etc. 

### Submission instructions
