## Instruction & Office hours

**Format of the class:** In-class time will be a combination of lectures, group assignments, live coding, and student presentations.  **Please note:** Circumstances may require the face-to-face portion of the class to be online.

**Time:** 

**Office Hours:**  

**TA Office Hours:**  

## Textbooks 

## Computing

The course will be taught using XX

## Learning objectives

This course covers the fundamentals of probability theory and stochastic processes. The goal of the course is that students will become conversant in the tools of probability.  At the end of the course, students should be able to clearly describe and implement concepts related to random variables, properties of probability, distributions, expectations, moments, transformations, model fit, basic inference, sampling distributions, discrete and continuous time Markov chains, and Brownian motion.  The course will illustrate most topics with both analytic and computational solutions.

## Final Exam

The final exam will XX.

## Deliverables and Problem sets

There will be XX assignments.  Some of the assignments will be traditional problem sets.  Others will be more substantial projects requiring you to perform a simulation and summarize findings in a blog format.  Each assignment will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Students will have opportunities to resubmit each assignment multiple times within a 2 week window after of initial feedback.

## A few Policies that will Govern the Class

Grading Policies: Courses carrying a Data Science subject area use the following grading system: A, A-; B+, B, B-; C+, C, C-; D+, D, D-; F.  The symbol W is used when a student officially drops a course before its completion or if the student withdraws from an academic program of the University.

Grading Scale: 

 - 93-100 A
 - 90-92 A- 
 - 87-89 B+
 - 83-86 B 
 - 80-82 B- 
 - 77-79 C+ 
 - 73-76 C 
 - 70-72 C- 
 - <70 F

University of Virginia Honor System: All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. The instructor will indicate which assignments and activities are to be done individually and which permit collaboration. The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.


Special Needs:  The University of Virginia accommodates students with disabilities. Any SCPS student with a disability who needs accommodation (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, just follow up with me concerning any logistics and implementation of accommodations.  Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the SDAC: 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-5188/Fax. Further policies and statements are available at www.virginia.edu/studenthealth/sdac/sdac.html
